        <h2>Kyoto, Japan</h2>
        <p>Kansai is made up of four major cities. There is the bustling neon jugle of Osaka, Japan's second largest city. Towards the west is the beautiful city of Kobe which is located on a narrow peice of land that is sandwiched by a mountain and the
            sea. To the east are the two ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto. Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794. But the jewel in Japan's amazing site-seeing crown is the city of Kyoto. The last time it was the capital of Japan was in 1869.

        <p>There are literally thousands of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines in Kyoto. One of the great joys is to wander along the streets and discover some ancient small temple nestled between a couple of modern buildings. Some of Japan's key sites
            are contained with this city, that is itself ringed by mountains.The variety, historical span and sheer number of World Heritage Sites in Kyoto is unrivaled in Japan. Nijo-jo Castle and the sixteen temples and shrines were selected as World
            Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1994. Kyoto is a wonderful example of a modern, working Japanese city that is sprinkled with sites that contain it&#39;s ancient past. Please take the time to read more about or visit and explore this wonderful
            city.</p>
